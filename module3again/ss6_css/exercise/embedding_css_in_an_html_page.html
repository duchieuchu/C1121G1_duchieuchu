<p style="font-size: 25px">A race that knows no finish line.</p>
<p class="content">In an old mill in 1967, two engineers with a passion for motorsports began turning Mercedes-Benz
    sedans into winning
    racecars. Today, AMG continues to create victory on the track and desire on the streets of the world. Every
    Mercedes-AMG vehicle is the product of craftsmen, designers, engineers and racers who live for a singular goal:
    Driving Performance.</p>

<p class="content01">Born to perform, developed to outperform</p>
<p class="content11">A Mercedes-AMG engine starts with the state of the art. Everything from fuel pressure to exhaust routing is developed
    to quicken, heighten and intensify its response, and yours. From patented processes to cut friction to a new
    generation of electrified performance, AMG technology is fueled by its racing success.</p>
